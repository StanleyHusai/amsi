/**
 * Example of use of the imuFactors (imuFactor and combinedImuFactor) in conjunction with GPS
 *  - you can test imuFactor (resp. combinedImuFactor) by commenting (resp. uncommenting)
 *  the line #define USE_COMBINED (few lines below)
 *  - we read IMU and GPS data from a CSV file, with the following format:
 *  A row starting with "i" is the first initial position formatted with
 *  N, E, D, qx, qY, qZ, qW, velN, velE, velD
 *  A row starting with "0" is an imu measurement
 *  linAccN, linAccE, linAccD, angVelN, angVelE, angVelD
 *  A row starting with "1" is a gps correction formatted with
 *  N, E, D, qX, qY, qZ, qW
 *  Note that for GPS correction, we're only using the position not the rotation. The
 *  rotation is provided in the file for ground truth comparison.
