### All Source Positioning And Navigation Solution (ASPANS)

This package seeks to provide navigation solution in diverse scenarios using different sensors, with:
## Capabilities
- plug-and-play capability
- adaptive fusion
- sensors subset selection 
- sensor fault detection
- evaluation of algorithm: filtering (eg.EKF) and smoothing (eg. factor graph)

## Package description
   - amsi- adaptive multi-sensor integration
   - nlosExclusion- GNSS NLOS exclusion
   - rtklibros- rtklib in ros package
   - Mapping- LiDAR mapping and its integration with GNSS (SLAM)

## How to use this for your data

The data is saved in Dropbox. The data for public will be opened soon,
